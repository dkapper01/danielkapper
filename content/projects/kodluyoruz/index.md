Created a Progressive Web App for a client using GatsbyJS, a static site generator. I used React to build components and GraphQL to pull in data, and integrated Contentful, a Headless Content Management System, so the content can be easily edited. I also designed a modern layout using Styled Components and CSS Grid, and set up continuous development using Netlify and Github. The web application also programmatically generate web pages from markdown files.

### Built with
